# Blockchain-
This project focuses on creating, securing, and validating new blocks in a blockchain using cryptographic techniques. It ensures data integrity and immutability by linking blocks via cryptographic hashes. Consensus algorithms like Proof of Work/Stake validate the blocks, ensuring security and preventing tampering in decentralized networks.
